### Introduction

Although I am no expert, in my attempt to study how quantum computers and their algorithms work Ive often found that you can easily give a simple explanation and example for how it works after you have dug tirelessly through all the equations. In this post I'm going to attempt explain Grover's Algorithm in the simplest way I can.

$$ \require{braket} \bra{x} \ket{x} $$

Here we have Bra-Ket notation which is used to denote the state of a quantum system.
